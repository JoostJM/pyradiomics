  Control level of logger and stderr output of the toolbox. By default, this output reflects module hierarchy, as child
  loggers are created by module. This is achieved by the following line in base.py:
  ``self.logger = logging.getLogger(self.__module__)``. To use same instance in each module, set
  ``self.logger=logging.getLogger('radiomics')``.

  At command line, turn on debugging output to stderr for all pyradiomics functions with:

  ``import radiomics``\n
  ``radiomics.debug()``

  This set the level of both the logger and the handler for output to stderr to level = DEBUG. If level of logger is
  already at level "DEBUG" or "NOTSET", level of logger is not changed.

  Turn off debugging with (only changes the level of the handler for output to stderr):

  ``radiomics.debug(False)``

  By default, the radiomics logger is set to level "INFO" and the stderr handler to level "WARNING". Therefore a log
  storing the extraction log messages from level "INFO" and up can be easily set up by adding an appropriate handler to
  the radiomics logger.
